Easy SAML authentication plugin for Moodle
by Jonathon Fowler <jf@jonof.id.au>

The perks of this plugin:
  â€“ Drop-in, configure, off you go. There are no dependencies
    on webserver extensions or third-party SAML service
    provider packages.
  - No loss of access to Moodle manual accounts or other
    authentication schemes. Sign-on redirection can be enabled
    to happen automatically, but you can still bypass it as
    need be.

The limitations of this plugin:
  - No enrolment handling functionality. This is a simple and
    easy-to-use plugin after all.

The PHP mcrypt extension is required for SAML signing,
encryption, and decryption functionality.

This plugin was developed with simpleSAMLphp as IdP, and has
had heavy production use with F5 BIG-IP APM (11.6) as IdP.

The OneLogin php-saml library provides the SAML2 services and
is available from https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml.
The lib and extlib directories of that library are used in
this plugin.
